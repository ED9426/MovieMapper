The Backend Developer retrieves movie information from movie.csv by calling Data Wrangler's method, stores and reads movie information through genre and rating hash tables, and resolves the collision in the hash table by chaining.

### Description
This application will allow users to explore a movie data set and find new movies to watch. The data set contains short descriptions, user rating averages, one or more genres, and additional metadata (including title, actors, and director) for each of the movies. Users will be able to select search criteria which consist of one or more genres to select movies by and a range of ratings. Users will be able to select any set of genres, and rating ranges. The system will then display the number of movies that fit the search criteria and the top three of these movies (by rating) with additional details. Users will be able to scroll through the entire list of movies or adapt the search criteria at any time with the app. Primary users of the app will be people who want to find new and interesting movies to watch.
